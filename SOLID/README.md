# SOLID PRINCIPLES

**The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.**

These five principles help us understand the need for certain design patterns and software architecture in general. So I believe that it is a topic that every developer should learn.

# **Background**

The SOLID principles were first introduced by the famous Computer Scientist Robert J. Martin (a.k.a Uncle Bob) in his [paper](https://fi.ort.edu.uy/innovaportal/file/2032/1/design_principles.pdf) in 2000. But the SOLID acronym was introduced later by Michael Feathers.

Uncle Bob is also the author of bestselling books *Clean Code* and *Clean Architecture*, and is one of the participants of the ["Agile Alliance"](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html).

Therefore, it is not a surprise that all these concepts of clean coding, object-oriented architecture, and design patterns are somehow connected and complementary to each other.

They all serve the same purpose:

> "To create understandable, readable, and testable code that many developers can collaboratively work on."

Let's look at each principle one by one. Following the SOLID acronym, they are:

- The **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- The **O**pen-Closed Principle
- The **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- The **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- The **D**ependency Inversion Principle


### LETS SEE WHAT EACH PRINCIPLE STATES


- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): **A class should have a single responsibility.**

- Open/Closed Principle (OCP): **A class should be open for extension but closed for modification**.

- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): **A child class must be substitutable for its parent class**.

- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): **Use many small interfaces instead of a big interface**.

- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): **Make the high-level module dependent on abstraction, not the low-level module**.
